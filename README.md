### How does it work?###

 OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a configuration file. To intercept the client's connection and disconnections we have to use the following options:

**--client-connect** - Run script on client connection
**--client-disconnect** â€“ Run script on client instance shutdown.

For this to work, you have to add the following lines in you openvpn server config file:

script-security 2

--client-connect "client-connect.bat"

--client-disconnect "client-disconnect.bat"
